# Board Feet Calculator

For calculating board feet as conveniently as possible.

The default iOS keypad is not very convenient for numeric input. Using `<input type="number">` makes it a little better, but there are still too many extra keys taking up space. `pattern="[0-9]*"` gives a nice numpad, but it lacks symbols, and makes some browsers perform validation on the field. So, I made my own keypad! It has the keys needed for calculating board footage, and no more.
